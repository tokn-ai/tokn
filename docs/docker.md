# Running the gateway in Docker

The image runs `tokn-gateway serve`. It does not override listener addresses,
authentication, or the number of listeners. Mount a configured router state
directory; the image does not provision upstream accounts or an unauthenticated
public listener.

For a new, isolated state directory:

```sh
mkdir -p router-state
cp examples/docker/config.toml router-state/config.toml
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/router-state:/root/.tokn/router" \
  tokn-gateway-cli:local api-key create local-client
docker run --name tokn-gateway --stop-timeout 40 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:4141:4141 \
  -v "$(pwd)/router-state:/root/.tokn/router" tokn-gateway-cli:local
```

Use your actual image tag in place of `tokn-gateway-cli:local`. Save the generated
client key and send it in `Authorization: Bearer KEY`. The sample configuration
uses `client_auth = "local_keys"` and explicitly allows plaintext on the
container's non-loopback interface so Docker's bridge can reach it. Keep the
explicit host-loopback publication shown above: **do not use `-p 4141:4141`,
`-p 0.0.0.0:4141:4141`, or host networking with this plaintext example.** The
configuration cannot enforce Docker's host-side publication, and bearer tokens
are not encrypted by client authentication.

For remote access, terminate TLS in a reverse proxy and keep the gateway backend
on host loopback or a dedicated container network accessible only to trusted
services. Publish the TLS proxy, not the plaintext gateway; a trusted network
alone is not a substitute for TLS on the client-facing connection. Upstream
accounts are managed separately with the account commands in the same mounted
state directory.

## Shutdown

On macOS and Linux, `serve` runs a worker attached to an independent frontend.
The first SIGINT or SIGTERM marks the worker exiting and transfers new requests
to another eligible worker, when available. Existing worker requests drain
without a deadline. A second signal forces immediate exit with status 130.
The frontend remains running; see [worker lifecycle](version-dispatch.md#worker-states-and-ctrl-c).

Signalling the frontend stops its public listeners and allows active API and
decoded proxy requests up to 30 seconds to finish. Idle keep-alive connections
and opaque CONNECT tunnels close immediately. The standalone legacy `proxy start`
also bounds draining to 30 seconds. On Windows, `serve` uses the standalone runtime
and its bounded shutdown path.

Request, usage, session, and archival handlers then get up to five seconds for
cleanup. A drain or cleanup timeout is logged and returns a nonzero exit status;
timed-out cleanup cannot guarantee that every queued record was written. The
async runtime gets a final one-second bounded wait for blocking background
tasks. Allow at least 40 seconds for bounded frontend shutdown. Worker shutdown can
take longer if an upstream stream remains active:

```sh
docker stop --time 40 tokn-gateway
```

A listener startup/runtime failure stops and drains sibling listeners before
the same cleanup path runs. Invalid configuration or a failed listener never
leaves a partially serving process running.

CI runs `bash scripts/docker/smoke.sh IMAGE` against the built image with
disposable state. It checks default-command startup, unauthenticated rejection,
authenticated discovery, and successful SIGTERM cleanup without upstream calls.
